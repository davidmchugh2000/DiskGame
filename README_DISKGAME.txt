The problem given to me was making a game where you place randomly colored disks on the board. The game is over is the disks overlap, the disk is placed out of bounds, or the timer runs out. 

This project is more of a backend project with a basic GUI

This project was not super intense but it was a project early on in CS201, my Java-based programming class. The idea of the project was not hard but the logic of the disk interacting with the GUI was the hardest part. I left in all my "bad code" to let you experience what I was thinking at the time and how I worked around my problems. After a bit of trial and error, I was able to get the game fully complete. It was a super fun project and I was proud that I was able to figure it out from just a skeleton of methods given to us.
